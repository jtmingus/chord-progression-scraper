# chord-progression-scraper

Scraper to pull common chord progressions from [HookTheory API](https://www.hooktheory.com/api/trends/docs).

All chord progressions are stored in output/processed.txt. Note that the starts of each chord progression are also stored there. For example, in a I-V-vi-IV chord progression, we would have separate entries for I, I-V, I-V-vi, and I-V-vi-IV.
